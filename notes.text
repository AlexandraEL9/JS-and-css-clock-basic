-Apply rotate to each of the hands depenting on what time it is
  eg
transform: rotate(20deg);
but that rotates centrally (not good for our clock)

we want to otate on the very right hand side 
(middle of clock)
- need to transform the 'origin'
eg
   within .hand {
    transform-origin: 100%
   }
 rotate hands so start at 12o clock
 - transform: rotate(90deg)
